# LOTTOi Public Verification Structure Whitepaper
*(English Version)*

---

## 1. Document Overview

LOTTOi operates a public verification structure in which  
numbers generated by users are recorded in external systems  
**prior to the lottery draw**, allowing **anyone to independently verify**  
whether those records were altered afterward.

This document is not intended to describe algorithms or prediction performance.  
Instead, it explains the **operational and verification structure**, including  
record creation timing, public disclosure methods, and how change histories  
can be independently verified using external references.

---

## 2. Core Principles of the Public Verification Structure

LOTTOi’s public verification structure is based on the following principles:

- Records are created **before the lottery draw**
- Records are stored in **third-party external systems**
- Any **changes and their timing cannot be concealed**
- Verification is performed by **anyone**, not the operator

Rather than preventing modifications entirely,  
LOTTOi is structurally designed so that **any modification, if it occurs,  
is fully traceable and cannot be hidden**.

## 3. Overall Public Verification Flow (Actual Operational Standard)

[Creation of a Round-Specific Google Public Document]
└ Initially created with read-only (Viewer) permission
└ Creation timestamp automatically recorded by Google system
↓
[Logging Google Document URL & Timestamp on GitHub]
└ Initial URL record externally fixed
└ Any modification reflected through GitHub commit history
↓
[User Number Generation (Recommendation / Generation)]
↓
[Lottery Draw Day (Saturday, 20:00 ~ 20:30)]
└ Google document permission switched to editable
└ Permission change timestamp also recorded externally
↓
[Storing User-Generated Numbers in Google Public Document]
└ Storage time and change history automatically recorded
↓
[Lottery Draw]
↓
[Anyone Can Verify Creation Time, Permission Changes, and Modification History]

## 4. Role of the GitHub Log

The GitHub log is **not used to store numbers or results**.  
Its purpose is to act as an **external reference anchor**, fixing the earliest  
moment when the Google public document URL existed externally.

Through this, the following can be verified:

- The document URL was **not created after the lottery draw**
- The document was already accessible externally  
  before the GitHub logging timestamp

GitHub records may be updated if necessary,  
and **all changes are transparently disclosed via commit history**.

---

## 5. Google Document Permission Management

### 5-1. Initial Document Creation
- Read-only (Viewer) permission
- Prevents premature modification
- Creation timestamp automatically recorded

### 5-2. Lottery Draw Day (Saturday, 20:00 ~ 20:30)
- Immediately before saving user-generated numbers
- Document permission switched to editable
- Permission change timestamp recorded by Google system

This ensures that all preparatory actions taken by LOTTOi  
before the draw are preserved as **externally verifiable time-based records**.

---

## 6. Modification and Change History Policy

After the lottery draw, the Google public document remains editable,  
and modifications may be made by the operator or authorized parties.

However, in all cases, the following are automatically recorded:

- Time of modification
- Content changes
- Order of changes

As a result, anyone can independently verify  
whether modifications occurred after the draw,  
and **no change can be concealed**.

---

## 7. Policy for Pre-Draw Corrections (e.g., URL Input Errors)

Operational issues such as incorrect Google document URLs  
may require GitHub log updates prior to the draw.

In such cases, all of the following remain publicly visible:

- Initial logging timestamp
- Modification timestamp
- URLs before and after correction

Verification is based on whether the **final confirmed URL existed  
before the lottery draw**, and whether all corrections occurred  
prior to that time.

---

## 8. Key Elements for External Public Verification

[Key Elements for External Public Verification]

└ GitHub Repository
· Verify the initial logging timestamp of the Google document URL
· Confirm that the timestamp precedes the lottery draw
· Review commit history for any modifications and their timing

└ Google Document
· Verify document creation time and modification history
· Confirm the final content state before the draw
(Saturday, before 20:35)
· Download the document as of that reference time if needed


---

## 9. Technical Limitations and Operational Notice

Temporary delays may occur due to:

- Network latency
- Google or GitHub platform issues
- Other technical factors

Even in such cases, actual creation times and modification histories  
remain recorded in external systems, allowing the relationship  
between record timing and the lottery draw to be verified afterward.

This structure does not justify delays;  
it ensures that **any delay itself cannot be concealed**.

---

## 10. Scope and Limitations of This Document

This whitepaper is intended to:

- Explain the structural approach to preventing result manipulation
- Provide understanding of the public verification process
- Enable anyone to verify records using consistent criteria

This document does **not** guarantee winning probabilities, performance,  
or outcomes, and should not be interpreted as an investment or prediction guide.

---

## 11. Closing

Before recording results, LOTTOi records  
**the entire preparation process as externally verifiable history**.

Rather than remaining a differentiating feature of a single service,  
LOTTOi hopes that public verification becomes a shared trust standard  
that enhances informed user choice across the lottery-related ecosystem.
